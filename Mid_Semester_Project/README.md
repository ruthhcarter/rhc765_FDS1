# Midsemester Calculator Project: 
This program can calculate the mean, variance, standard deviation/error, and z-score for a user-inputted list of numbers. 

To begin, run the "Menu" code. Follow the labeled options. The program will keep your list of numbers until you Quit. So, if you wish to add more numbers to your list, simply hit Option 1 again.
