    "In this tutorial, we have learned how to use a very powerful tool in coding: the `for` loop. We've also seen how to use it with both `range()` objects and ***iterables***. We learned how to store the results of a `for` loop, and seen that loops can be \"nested\", that is, placed within one another. We also learned about a shorthand `for` loop, the list comprehension. Finally, we learned the cute little `input()` function that makes playing with code interactive and therefore even more fun."
